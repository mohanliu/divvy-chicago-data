Divvy is Chicago's bike share system, with 580 stations and 5,800 bikes across Chicagoland. 
Itâ€™s a fun, affordable and convenient way to get around. 
In this effort, I am going to understand how people in Chicago make use of the divvy bikes 
and build machine learning and deep learning models to predict the number of bikes has been 
rented or returned for each station during a certain time period (which can be a day or a few hours).  
Eventually, this project will be beneficial to the Divvy bike company in several ways. 
Firstly, they will be able to foresee the demand of bikes in a future time for a certain station so that
they can distribute their bikes accordingly beforehand. 
Additionally, the model will also be helpful and provide some valuable insights of what locations 
should the divvy bike company will open up new bike stations. 

The main dataset I will work on is shared by Divvy company with the details of each bike trip for 
the last past five years, including the start station, destination station, start time, end time and etc. 
In addition to that, I am also considering collecting external data such as historical weather data in Chicago 
and special events held in Chicago, since these information might help improve the performance of our model.
